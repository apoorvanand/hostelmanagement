# Model to represent Housing Draws.
#
# @attr name [String] The name of the housing draw -- e.g. "Junior Draw 2016"
# @attr students [Array<User>] The students in the draw.
# @attr suites [Array<Suite>] The suites in the draw.
# @attr status [String] The status / phase of the draw (draft, pre_lottery,
#   lottery, suite_selection). Note the use of underscores in the status
#   strings; this prevents some unpleasantness with the helper methods.
# @attr locked_sizes [Array<Integer>] the group sizes that are restricted.
# @attr intent_locked [Boolean] True when students in the draw can no longer
#   update their housing intent.
# @attr last_email_sent [Datetime] The time the last reminder email was sent
# @attr email_type [Integer] Enum with the type of the last email sent
#   (currently intent or locking reminders)
# @attr intent_deadline [Datetime] Deadline to set intent. Not strictly
#   enforced, just used for display purposes and sending emails.
# @attr locking_deadline [Datetime] Deadline to lock groups. Not strictly
#   enforced, just used for display purposes and sending emails.
